# SAP Event Broker Take Home Problem

The following take home problem is to help us learn a a bit more about your coding style and creative problem solving. In
general we prefer this approach rather than forcing candidates to code during the interview. It is purposely very open ended
and you can tackle the problem in a wide range of ways.

## Guidelines

-   Please do not spend more than 2 to 3 hours on the problem. Your time is valuable and there are no bonus points for candidates who do more than that.

-   Think of this like an open source project. Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built for the newcomer to your project.

-   Our team builds systems engineered to run in production. Given this, please organize, design, and document your solution as if you were going to put into production. We completely understand this might mean you can't do as much in the time budget. Be biased for production-ready over features.

-   Document tradeoffs, the rationale behind your technical choices, or things you would do or do differently if you were able to spend more time on the project or do it again.

-   Use whatever languages, libraries, tools etc. you feel like. 

## The Problem

We the North American team who are split across Boulder and Montreal often enjoy spending time in the outdoors. Some of us would like to bike while some of us are happy just walking, some of us like to challenge ourselves with difficult hikes while some of us would like to ease in slowly. 

The good part is that the Boulder county releases data about the trails as open data. Your assignment is to help us find a trail that suits our requirement.

This is a freeform assignment. You can write a web API that returns a set of trails. You can write a web frontend that visualizes the trails. We also spend a lot of time in the shell, so a CLI that gives us a couple of options would be great. 

The only requirement for the assignment is that it allow us to filter the trails by at least 2 criteria. You can choose to pivot the choices based on any of the options in there - bike trail vs walking trail, with the option of fishing vs not etc.

Feel free to tackle this problem in a way that demonstrates your expertise of an area or takes you out of your comfort zone.

Boulder's trail head data is [located here](https://opendata-bouldercounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/3a950053bbef46c6a3c2abe3aceee3de_0/explore) you can download a CSV of the data from that site. We have included a copy of the CSV in this repo as well.
